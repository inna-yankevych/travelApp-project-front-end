This project is the frontend application of the TravelApp system. It works together with the TravelApp backend server to provide users with a visual interface for browsing countries, cities, activities, essential travel information and wishlist. It retrieves data directly from the backend API. Users can navigate smoothly between pages, view detailed information and interact with travel data in a intuitive way. This frontend was built using modern web technologies to provide excellent user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

1. **React(react, react-dom)** is the main Javascript library used to build the user interface. It allows the app to use components, hooks, and virtual DOM rendering to create a fast and dynamic experience. It is one of the most widely adopted technologies for frontend development, used by companies such as Meta, Netflix and Airbnb. Alternatives are Vue.js and Angular, but React was chosen for flexibility, wide support, and faster learning curve. Licensing under MIT licence.
2. **React Router (react-router-dom)** enables client-side page navigation without refreshing the whole app. It is the standard routing library in React projects. Alternatives are Next.js and TanStack Router but are less commonly used. Licensing under MIT licence.
3. **Axios** is the HTTP client used for making requests to the TravelApp backend API. It is popular in React applications due to better error objects, interceptors, and request cancellation. Alternative is Fetch API, which is built-in, but lacks some convenience features; SuperAgent is older and less adopted. Licensing under MIT licence. 
4. **Vite** is the build tool used for development and production builds. It is now the most commonly used frontend build tool because it is significantly faster. Alternatives are Create React App, which is slower and depreciated, and Webpacl, powerful but requires complex configuration. Licensing under MIT licence. 
5. **ESLint & Plugins** enforce consistent coding style and prevent common JavaScript and React errors. It is the standard linting tool in JavaScript projects. Licensing under MIT licence. 
6. **Testing Libraries (vitest,@testing-library, jsdom)** are used to perform unit tests and simulate DOM behavior. React Testing Library and Vitest are the standard tools for testing React in modern projects. Jest is popular but slower; Cypress is for end-to-end testing rather than unit tests. Licensing under MIT licence.
